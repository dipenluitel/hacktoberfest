/*
Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....

If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Note:The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to make changes in the original array itself.
