// Time complexity: O(N2), (where N = size of the array), for the best, worst, and average cases.
// Reason: If we carefully observe, we can notice that the outer loop, say i, is running from 0 to n-2 i.e. n-1 times, and for each i, the inner loop j runs from i to n-1. For, i = 0, the inner loop runs n-1 times, for i = 1, the inner loop runs n-2 times, and so on. So, the total steps will be approximately the following: (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ……..+ 3 + 2 + 1. The summation is approximately the sum of the first n natural numbers i.e. (n*(n+1))/2. The precise time complexity will be O(n2/2 + n/2). Previously, we have learned that we can ignore the lower values as well as the constant coefficients. So, the time complexity is O(n2). Here the value of n is N i.e. the size of the array.

// Space Complexity: O(1)
